Michelle Munguia GarciaSurvey Monkey SurveyPrompt: Create a survey for me to understand users of a website that I have to build to provide information about a senior living facility/ nursing home to people of age 50 to 60 so that I can create user persona and user need statements. Insert the link to the survey here:  Senior Living Survey Link 
 Interview usersAge of the individual 57 Gender of the individual Male Interview questions and answersWould you prefer a senior living facility with a more intimate, smaller community or a larger, more expansive facility?  I I’d definitely prefer a smaller, more intimate community. I think it’s important to be in a place where I can form real connections with people. Big, expansive facilities can sometimes feel too impersonal What type of ambiance do you think would help you feel most comfortable in a senior living facility? II want a balance between having a peaceful space to unwind but also areas where I can engage with others if I feel like it. Which type of environment would you prefer in a senior living facility: a hotel-like setting with luxury amenities or a more private, residential community feel? d go with the residential community feel. I’m not really into the luxury hotel-type experience—it can feel a bit too much. I’d prefer a more laid-back, homey vibe where I can feel relaxed and at ease, with enough privacy but also a sense of community around me. That feels like a place I’d enjoy more in the long run. What would make you feel confident about the decision to move into a senior living facility? What would really help me feel confident is clear, transparent information. I want to know exactly what I’m getting into such as services offered, costs, and reviews from people who’ve actually lived there. Also, knowing that the place is staffed by genuinely caring people who respect my independence but are there when I need them would go a long way. 
 How important is the availability of healthcare services in a senior living facility? It’s pretty high on the list for me. I’m in good health now, but I know that can change. I’d want to be in a place where healthcare services are available and easily accessible, just in case. I don’t need anything overly invasive, but it’s good to know there’s support if I ever need it down the line. User Need StatementsAs a user, I need clear and understandable information about the services and amenities offered at the senior living facility so that I can make an informed decision about whether it meets my needs. As a user, I need the option to access detailed information about the facility’s atmosphere, including its community vibe and available activities, so that I can determine if it aligns with my lifestyle and preferences. As a user, I need access to testimonials and reviews from current or past residents and their families so that I can get a real sense of the facility’s quality of care and community. As a user, I need a website with a user-friendly design and tools like virtual tours or contact options so I can explore the facility remotely before making an in-person visit.  
As a user, I need to be able to easily find healthcare service options and support available at the facility, including emergency care, to ensure my future healthcare needs will be met.
