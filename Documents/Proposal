Project Description 
   

Retirement Home – Assisted Living 
Target Users: Future Senior residents, family of residents, current seniors living in assisted living 
facilities, caregivers, volunteers, insurance providers, and local communities. 
Description:  
A retirement home website called “Horizon Living” would serve and connect possible residents 
and families. The website would advertise a location and provide information and resources about 
it. The website would have to be user-friendly considering our audience.  
The website would prioritize the needs of residents and accessibility to make this website easy to 
navigate. We would showcase our facilities, accommodations, staff, pricing, tours and contact 
information to help residents decide if this is the home and community right for them. We would 
have health services and wellness programs that are available for current residents at our facility. 
We would host a blog/gallery tab to show families to have updates or community events that were 
hosted. This website would create an accessible space for anyone looking for a retirement 
community.

1. If none exists, you need to mention that your site is the first of its kind.   
2. If any exists, then mention how your site would be different from those so that 
people know you are merely re-inventing the wheel. 
  
How our site would differentiate from the rest: 
We could add a community events calander and a facility news page. We could have a 
reviews tab where potential clients could read reviews from current residents. A cost
estimator tool is also something that would be different from similar sites.

information.
